# Canny-edge-detection

This repository contains the work done for the project of the Parallel Computing course (COMP.CE.350). The goal was to parallelize the Canny's algorithm for edge detection using CPU parallelism offered by OpenMP and GPU parallelism through OpenCL. The OpenMP and OpenCL folders contain all the files for the respective parts.
